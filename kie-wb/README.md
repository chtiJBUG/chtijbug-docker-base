Introduction
------------

The image contains:     
          
* JBoss Wildfly 10.0.0.Final
* Chtijbug Workbench 2.0.6.Final based on the kie  workbench 6.5.0

This image inherits from `jboss/drools-workbench:latest` and provides some additional configurations:                   

* Default users and roles               
* Some examples            

This is a **ready to run Docker image for JBoss Drools Workbench**. Just run it and try the Drools workbench!                       

Usage
-----

To run a container:
    
    docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 8001:8001 -d --name kie-workbench chtijbug/kie-wb:latest
Once container and web applications started, you can navigate to it using one of the users described in section `Users and roles`, using the following URL:             

        http://localhost:8080/kie-wb

Please note that in this image the examples and demos are enabled by default, so you **need external connection to [GitHub](https://github.com/)**. 

    
Users and roles
----------------

This showcase image contains default users and roles:

Logging
-------

You can see all logs generated by the `standalone` binary running:

    docker logs [-f] <container_id>
    
You can attach the container by running:

    docker attach <container_id>

The Drools Workbench web application logs can be found inside the container at path:

    /opt/jboss/wildfly/standalone/log/server.log

    Example:
    sudo nsenter -t $(docker inspect --format '{{ .State.Pid }}' $(docker ps -lq)) -m -u -i -n -p -w
    -bash-4.2# tail -f /opt/jboss/wildfly/standalone/log/server.log

GIT internal repository
-----------------------

The workbench stores all the project artifacts in an internal GIT repository. By default, the protocol available for accessing the GIT repository is `SSH` at port `8001`.            

This showcase image provides some examples at the `uf-playground` repository, that you can clone it by running:                 
 
    git clone ssh://admin@localhost:8001/onboarding-nautic-project

By default, the GIT repository is created when the application starts for first time at `$WORKING_DIR/.niogit`, considering `$WORKING_DIR` as the current directory where the application server is started.            

You can specify a custom repository location by setting the following Java system property to your target file system directory:                   
 
        -Dorg.uberfire.nio.git.dir=/home/youruser/some/path

NOTE: This directory can be shared with your docker host and with another containers using shared volumes when running the container, if you need so.            

If necessary you can make GIT repositories available from outside localhost using the following Java system property:                 
 
        -org.uberfire.nio.git.ssh.host=0.0.0.0
        
You can set this Java system properties permanent by adding the following lines in your `standalone-full.xml` file as:                
 
        <system-properties>
          <!-- Custom repository location. -->
          <property name="org.uberfire.nio.git.dir" value="/home/youruser/some/path"/>
          <!-- Make GIT repositories available from outside localhost. -->
          <property name="org.uberfire.nio.git.ssh.host" value="0.0.0.0"/>
        </system-properties>

    
NOTE: Users and password for ssh access are the same that for the web application users defined at the realm files.   

Persistent configuration
------------------------

As Docker defaults, once a container has been removed, the data within that container is removed as well.                

At first glance this should not imply any issues as the assets authored on your workbench containers are not lost if you don't remove the container, you can stop and restart it 
as many times as you need, and have different kie execution server container's consuming those assets, the problem comes if you need to remove and create new workbench containers.                                       
          
In the case you need to create a persistent environment you can use an approach based on [Docker Volumes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockervolumes/). Here are two ways of doing it.           

**Using default GIT root directory**               

By default, the internal GIT root directory for the workbench container is located at `/opt/jboss/wildfly/bin/.niogit`, so you can make this directory persistent in your docker host by running the container using a docker shared volumne as:                   

    # Use -v <SOURCE_FS_PATH>:<CONTAINER_FS_PATH>
    docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 8001:8001 -v /home/myuser/wb_git:/home/niodir -v /home/myuser/lucene:/home/lucene  -d --name drools-workbench jboss/drools-workbench-showcase:latest
    
As the above command, now your workbench git repository will be persistent at your host filesystem's path `/home/myuser/wb_git`. So if you remove this container and start a new one just by using same shared volume, you'll find all your assets on the new workbench's container as well.                   
The volume /home/myuser/lucene will containt the indexes.
